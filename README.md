# DO180 Workgroup - Deploying applications to OpenShift

Code to support my presentation for OCP workgroup. Each section deploys an
example application to OpenShift in a slightly different way.

Start with 01 and work in order through the rest.

**This repo uses NodeJS helloworld code from
https://github.com/DonSchenck/path-to-kubernetes.**
